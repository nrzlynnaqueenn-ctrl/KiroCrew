/**
 * Let the page currently on screen veto an in-app navigation that would unmount
 * it and destroy work the user typed.
 *
 * This is the same contract as `useSidePanelLeaveGuard`, one level further out.
 * That guard covers the exits a `SidePanelLayout` owns — its own tab rail and
 * mobile back bar — and `beforeunload` covers a real document unload. Neither
 * sees a CLIENT-SIDE ROUTE CHANGE: the global sidebar swaps the whole page
 * without the document ever unloading, so `beforeunload` never fires, and the
 * click belongs to the app shell rather than to any layout inside it.
 *
 * react-router's `useBlocker` is the mechanism that would normally answer this,
 * but it requires a data router (it reads `useDataRouterContext`) and the
 * dashboard mounts a plain `<BrowserRouter>`. So the veto is published the way
 * the pane-level one already is: the surface at risk registers an answer, and
 * the shell asks before it navigates.
 *
 * That makes coverage OPT-IN per navigation surface, which is the known cost of
 * this shape: an in-app `navigate()` caller that does not ask still discards a
 * draft, and forgetting to ask fails silently. The exits wired today are this
 * layout's rail and mobile back bar, the global sidebar's `NavItem`, the
 * command palette's `usePaletteActions` delegate, and `SettingsLink` -- the one
 * declarative Settings deep link, which asks once for every prose link built on
 * it rather than per call site. Imperative `navigate(settingsPath(...))` callers
 * (the update modal and pill, mobile connect, the approval-mode picker, the chat
 * voice branch) do NOT ask; they are modal or menu actions the user just chose,
 * and covering them one by one is the per-caller model this note argues against.
 * Browser Back/Forward cannot be reached from here at all. Retiring the
 * per-caller model -- a data router so `useBlocker` becomes available, or
 * lifting the draft so no exit destroys it -- is tracked in #8010; prefer adding
 * to that over wiring another individual caller here.
